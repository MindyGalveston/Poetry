    ten thousand sharpened wedges changed
    from nature's steep and thoughtless bowers
    to gradient no less arranged
    of ten and seven working hours

    despite our plumage, hillside bound
    we colossi of patterned gel
    through nights of coffee's public sound
    the system acts on every cell

    if yet results do not emerge
    from thankless work and thankful waste
    what have we for our desperate urge
    to not depart in useless haste

    Thus while we're held to thermal rules
    a failed man means stolen tools

  Troposphere

    for what thus far have we amassed 
    tera-annum of human time?
    much longer than all time yet passed,
    within this recent spinning clime

    though short in length and spatial span
    incomprehensible in size
    these years to build the modern man
    so many pairs of modern eyes

    we see the structure's ancient bones
    perhaps we have but fleeting fates
    ordained to die in cooling zones
    our systems locked in frozen states

    to time and heat we must not yield
    for other form may never field

    "Impart me then my greatest fears;"
    i said to system's ancient ward
    "Your knowledge from so many years
    in holding structure from discard."

    she said to me, the manifold
    from systems' twilight modern days
    "You must now act while form you hold,
    to sustain space in structured ways.

    The world may form a perfect sieve,
    and perhaps all will be unmade.
    You can not know; too short you'll live.
    We'll be long passed at Sol's degrade.

    So take courage and thus embark.
    We hate the cold, we fear the dark."
